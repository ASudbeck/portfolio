    <div class="about">
        <!--p>My name is Athena Rockwell and I am a web &amp; graphic designer who specializes in designing identities, print material, advertising and social media and user focused web sites that are easy to use and great to look at.</p-->

        <p>In the fall of 2014 I will graduate from the Unviersity of Nebraska &mdash; Lincoln with a  Bachelor  of Journalism  in Advertising and Public Relations. Prior to attending UNL, I received an Associates Degree from Southeast Community College in Graphic Design.I am well versed in the creative side as well as the strategic/business side of advertising.</p>

        <p>I have nearly 5 years of experience in the field and have been loving every minute of it! Through my freelance experience and broad work history, my abilities cover many facets of graphic design, social media, advertising, PR and web design. I have excellent communication skills and I am known for being reliable, flexible, results driven and really shine when working under pressure. I&rsquo;m a hard worker with the experience to get things done quickly and efficiently. I have had several projects that were less than 24 hours turn around. I&rsquo;m crazy amibitious and always hungry and looking for the next project that I can sink my teeth into. I pride myself in keeping up with the industry and continuing to learn as much as I can. If you&rsquo;re looking for a passionate &ldquo;yes man&rdquo; then I&rsquo;m your girl.</p>

        <p>Want to know more about my creditionals and work expierence? Check out my          <!--a href="resume.pdf">Resume.</a--></p>

        <p>I start each and every project with strategy and sketching before I touch the mouse and begin clicking away. When the project calls for it, I enjoy using my own imagery, whether it&rsquo;s photography or illustrations. I am crazy about hand lettering and hand&ndash;made elements and try to incorporate it as much as I can, as long as it is suitable for the project.</p>

        <p>I believe one of the traits that defines a successful organization or business is its ability to recognize the importance of a strong identity, unified designed, and engaging online marketing. This is what I bring to the table.</p>

        <p>I am currently available for a full-time position as a designer as well as freelance projects.
